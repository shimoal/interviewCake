// I have an array stock_prices_yesterday where: The indices are the
// time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local
// time. The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that
// time. For example, the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, so
// stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500. Write an efficient algorithm for
// computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1
// sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday. No "shorting"â€”you must buy before
// you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least
// 1 minute must pass).
